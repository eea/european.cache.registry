  Dear {{ first_name }} {{ last_name }},

  <p>
    User <b>{{ user }}</b> has locked down the match between <b>{{ company_name }}</b> company (registered in the {{ domain }} portal)
    and the old record <b>{{ oldcompany_name }}</b> (taken from BDR-Registry) due to suspicions that it was incorrect.

    <br>

    You can no longer modify the company collection until this situation is clarified by the <a href="mailto:{{ bdr_help_desk_email }}">BDR Help Desk</a>
  </p>
  <br>
  Best regards,<br>
  BDR Help Desk
