  Dear {{ first_name }} {{ last_name }},

  <p>
    User <b>{{ user }}</b> has unlocked the match between <b>{{ company_name }}</b> company (registered in the {{ domain }} portal)
    and the old record <b>{{ oldcompany_name }}</b> (taken from BDR-Registry) because the match was actually correct.

    <br>

    You can now modify the company collection
  </p>
  <br>
  Best regards,<br>
